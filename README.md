# UROP-MRI

This is a work in progress and will be used more as a place to collect my thoughts than as an intro to the project.  


##Project Description (from grant application)
This project is to design and implement a shape analysis routine to provide quantitative evidence of the affects of Kinesio Tape in the subcutaneous region.  
I will identify and evaluate methods of sequential shape analysis, pilot multiple methods, and characterize the usefulness of the varied methods within the context of MR image analysis.  The goals are to develop a novel routine to analyze the sequential change in size and shape of subcutaneous region affected by Kinesio Tape. 

This project will be the first quantitative study of the underlying mechanical affects of Kinesio Tape. Results could have large impact on the Kinesio Tape industry. Additionally, this study is expected to a provide general solution for quantitative assessment of morphological changes that could ultimately have broad implications for diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes beyond the current project.  



##Outcomes

 * literature review of current shape analysis techniques. 
 * implementation of some modern methods that should be applicable to this project
 * examination of the chosen methods
 * analysis of affects of Kinesio Tape
 * written and oral report



##Implementation Details
Most of the project is written in Python.

 * All landmark based techniques are in the python directory
 * Parameterization methods are handled by c++ in the cppp directory
 * General and Ordinary Procrustes Methods are handled by Procupy.
