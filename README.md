# UROP-MRI
This is the repo for my work on the shape analysis project.  This repo contains my grant submission, references, sample images, and the scripts to run the analysis.

The project is to analyze the underlying biomechanical effects of Kinesio Tape.  More generally, we seek to develop tools to characterize 3D shape change utilizing the entire surface, not a few landmarks. 
This work is advised by Dr. Yuriy Mileyko and Dr. Scott Lozanoff.  


Most of the project is written in Python.

General and Ordinary Procrustes Methods are handled by Procupy.
R is responsible for the Hotelling T2 testing (still in development)
