Title change:  Quantitative Analysis of the Biomechanical Effects of Kinesio Tape

Since its allowed use in the 2008 Olympics, Kinesio Tape has gained popularity among athletes as a method to diminish pain, prevent injury, and increase performance.  Currently, these purposed benefits are purely testimonial; there has been no objective evidence to substantiate these claims and many people believe that they are purely a result of marketer hype.   It is hypothesized that the claimed reduced pain and increased performance is the result of expansion of the subcutaneous region under the tape, relieving pressure on nerves and increasing fluid movement.   This study will compare changes in the region of interest for 20 participants with iliotibial band syndrome and 20 healthy patients. To do this, new shape analysis methods have been developed.  We have developed techniques to quantify and characterize minute shape changes of MR images and we will examine the subcutaneous region near the tape application and determine if the changes are in accordance with the claimed benefits.  We will present the novel methods and preliminary results of the efficacy of Kinesio Tape.  This will be the first quantitative analysis of the underlying biomechanical effects of the Kinesio Tape and has potential to greatly impact the tapeâ€™s market.
