we need to first generate 2 or 3 dimensional data.

then we generate all the statistics concerning this data.
then we fit a normal curve to the data.
then we see how good this normal curve works.
Then we confirm or deny that the data fits the normal curve. 



compute a p value.  - i think it is normal with this probability
test for multivariant normality.



look at pairwise difference over 3 time steps for a single patient 
with random noise (gaussia)

compute pairwise differences between landmarks
look at the point cloud-  this point cloud should have a gaussian distribution around
0.  should be close to zero..  norm of each difference

claim - will be close to zero with high probability (p-value)



first with gaussian random noise with mean 0, then introduce drift.

play with different drifts and different variances.  20 patients
20 experiences
normal noise with 0 mean and then normal noise with nonero mean


look at the norm of the 24 differences. norm of each point,  
make a profile of each patient.


focus on visualization



then look at the difference between landmarks.. 
pairwise distances-- 8 choose 2 length vector (28)
look at differences betweent the vectors.  

understand how these differences behave.


what c+++ toools

focus on generating lots of data..
